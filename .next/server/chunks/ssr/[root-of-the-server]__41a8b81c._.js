In fact, I provide coating is an excellent method for adding protection to stainless steel surfaces. To apply powder coating, the stainless steel surface must first be properly prepared. This involves surface cleaning and surface rust first removal on stainless steel surfaces. For surfaces with contaminated stainless steel, protective finishes are necessary, providing color options from colorful powder and adhesion. Next, powder is applied using an electrostatic spray gun, since baked it into the steel surface at high temperatures (around 350°C).
