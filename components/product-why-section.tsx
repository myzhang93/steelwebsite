          200 series stainless steel is primarily composed of chromium and manganese, with a low nickel content. 
          This series is a cost-effective alternative to the 300 series, offering good strength and formability, 
          though with slightly lower corrosion resistance. The 200 series is widely used in various industries 
          such as kitchen appliances, automotive, architecture, and more.
