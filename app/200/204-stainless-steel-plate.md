From deep-drawn kitchen sinks to mirror-polished elevator cabins, **204 stainless steel plate** keeps high-speed presses running and architectural budgets healthy. Discover why leading **204 stainless steel plate suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-duty applications.

## What is 204 Stainless Steel Plate? (UNS S20400)  
**204 stainless steel plate** is a nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic grade that maintains a fully austenitic structure for excellent formability and non-magnetic properties. The balanced chromium (15–17 %) and manganese (7–9 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while nitrogen (0.15–0.35 %) boosts yield strength above 350 MPa—far exceeding 304-cost ratios. Compared with 201/201L, grade 204 offers higher chromium and nickel, giving better pitting resistance; against 301, it provides superior corrosion performance and lower price volatility.
