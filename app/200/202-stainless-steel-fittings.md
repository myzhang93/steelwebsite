## Introduction  
Searching for stainless fittings that outperform 201 in strength yet undercut 304 in price? **202 stainless steel fittings** (UNS S20200) are your answer. This nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic grade delivers 30–40 % higher yield than 201 while slashing material cost by 35–45 % versus 304. From mirror-polished handrail elbows to deep-drawn tee reducers, **202 stainless steel fittings** keep high-speed presses running and architectural budgets healthy. Discover why leading **202 stainless steel fittings suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-duty fluid systems.

## What are 202 Stainless Steel Fittings? (UNS S20200)  
**202 stainless steel fittings** are nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic components that maintain full non-magnetic properties and excellent formability. The balanced chromium (17–19 %) and manganese (7.5–10 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while nitrogen (≤0.25 %) boosts yield strength above 350 MPa—far exceeding 201-cost ratios. Compared with 201, 304, or 316, **202 stainless steel properties** include better work-hardening rate and price stability, making them the first choice for cost-conscious projects that still demand 304-like aesthetics and strength.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1:** What is the difference between 202 and 304 stainless steel fittings?  
**A:** 202 uses manganese and nitrogen to replace most nickel, giving 30–40 % lower cost and similar urban corrosion resistance, but slightly less pitting resistance than 304.

**Q2:** Are 202 stainless steel fittings food safe?  
**A:** Yes, they meet FDA and GB 4806.9 for non-acidic food contact; widely used for display racks and conveyor frames.

**Q3:** Can 202 fittings be used outdoors?  
**A:** Suitable in urban or low-chloride environments; for coastal salt-spray, 316 is recommended.

**Q4:** Is 202 stainless steel magnetic?  
**A:** Essentially non-magnetic in annealed condition; permeability &lt;1.005 even after cold forming.

**Q5:** Why are 202 fittings much cheaper than 304?  
**A:** Reduced nickel raw-material cost and more stable alloy pricing shield buyers from LME nickel volatility.

**Q6:** Can 202 fittings be welded with 308L or 309 filler?  
**A:** Yes, ER308L is compatible; for color match use ER202 or ER309L.

**Q7:** Is 202 stronger than 201 stainless steel?  
**A:** Yes, 202 offers ~15 % higher yield strength and better corrosion resistance due to higher chromium and nitrogen content.
