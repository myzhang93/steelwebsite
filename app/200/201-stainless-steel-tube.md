# 201 Stainless Steel Tube – Economical, Corrosion-Resistant & Fabrication-Friendly

## Introduction  
When you need a stainless tubular that balances price, polish and performance, **201 stainless steel tube** stands out. By replacing part of the nickel with manganese and nitrogen, grade 201 delivers tensile strength 10–15 % higher than 304 while cutting material cost by 20–30 %. Its 16–18 % chromium skin resists urban corrosion, mild acids and cleaning chemicals, making **201 stainless steel tube** the first choice for furniture frames, handrails, automotive trim and display systems. Whether you buy round mechanical tubing or specify **201 stainless steel square tube for sale**, you get weld-ready, mirror-polishable, dimensionally accurate product that ships fast from a reliable **201 stainless steel tube supplier**—ideal for decorative and light structural projects where every dollar counts.

## Key Features & Benefits  
- **Lean Austenitic Chemistry** – Mn 5.5–7.5 % & N ≤0.25 % stabilise austenite, reduce nickel dependency and keep the alloy surcharge low on every **201 stainless steel tube for sale** shipment.  
- **Higher Cold-Work Strength** – Yield ≥310 MPa allows thinner walls, lighter weight and lower freight cost versus 304.  
- **Seamless & Welded Choices** – Cold-drawn seamless for pressure or aesthetic lines; HF-welded for economical structural sections—both in large **201 stainless steel seamless tube stock**.  
- **Square, Rectangular & Oval Profiles** – From 10 × 10 mm to 300 × 300 mm square; custom RHS and elliptical shapes available from any leading **201 stainless steel square tube supplier**.  
- **Mirror-Quality Polish** – 180G–600G mechanical polish, 8K mirror, satin-brush HL and embossed patterns give showroom-grade reflectivity for handrails and façades.  
- **Excellent Weldability** – Low carbon (&lt;0.08 %) prevents carbide precipitation; TIG, MIG, laser and orbital welding all pass ASTM A554 without post-weld anneal.  
- **Tight Dimensional Tolerance** – OD ±0.1 mm, WT ±8 %, Length 0 – +3 mm; ideal for CNC bending, robotic welding and automated assembly lines.  
- **100 % Recyclable** – Meets ISO 14021 environmental claims, helping contractors earn LEED credits and green-building certification points.

## Applications  
**201 stainless steel tube** is found wherever appearance and cost must coexist. Furniture makers bend square profiles into ergonomic chair frames and table legs; shopping centres use mirror-polished round tubes for handrails and balustrades that meet ASTM A554 loading codes. Automotive tier-1 suppliers form **201 stainless steel square tube** into roof-rack rails and exhaust tail-pipe resonators, capitalising on the alloy’s 650 °C oxidation resistance. Supermarkets weld slit-coil tubes into trolley frames and display racks, while food-service factories use sanitary-polished seamless tube for non-corrosive ingredient transfer. Architectural projects from Dubai malls to New York metro stations specify **201 stainless steel square tube for sale** as cladding framework, LED light troughs and signage posts. Even solar-panel racking systems adopt elliptical 202 tubes for their superior strength-to-weight ratio and stable **201 stainless steel tube price**.

## Why Choose 201 Stainless Steel Tube  
Compared with 430, **201 stainless steel tube** offers far better corrosion resistance and weldability; against 304, it sacrifices only marginal chloride performance yet saves 20–30 % on material cost—budget that can be reinvested in surface polishing or faster delivery. Its higher work-hardening rate allows thinner walls, reducing weight and shipping expense. Leading **201 stainless steel tube supplier** and **201 stainless steel square tube supplier** also highlight the grade’s stable manganese/nickel balance, ensuring consistent mechanical properties across 1–12 m lengths. Whether you need a mirror-polished handrail or a structural square frame, **201 stainless steel tube** gives you 304-like prestige at a 201-like cost.
