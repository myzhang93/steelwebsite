## Introduction  
Searching for a stainless sheet that welds like 304 but costs like 201? **201L stainless steel plate** (UNS S20103) is your answer. This extra-low-carbon, nitrogen-strengthened austenitic grade offers superior resistance to sensitization during welding, excellent deep-drawing performance and a mirror-polish brightness – all while slashing material cost by 25–40 % versus 304/304L. From elevator cabins to automotive trim, **201L stainless steel plate** keeps high-speed presses running and architectural budgets healthy. Discover why leading **201L stainless steel plate suppliers** worldwide are switching to this upgraded lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-duty applications.

## What is 201L Stainless Steel Plate? (UNS S20103)  
**201L stainless steel plate** is the extra-low-carbon version of grade 201 (C ≤0.03 %), minimizing carbide precipitation during welding and severe cold forming. High manganese (7.5–10 %) and nitrogen (≤0.25 %) maintain a fully austenitic structure, giving **201L stainless steel properties** comparable to 304 for urban corrosion, deep drawing and mirror polishing – yet at a fraction of the nickel cost. Compared with 201, 201L offers superior weld corrosion resistance; against 304/304L, it provides similar strength and formability while costing 25–40 % less.
