## Introduction  
Looking for a stainless grade that combines 304-level corrosion resistance with 30 % higher yield strength and a significantly lower price? **204 stainless steel sheet** is the answer. This nitrogen-strengthened, low-nickel austenitic alloy (UNS S20400) offers excellent formability, a bright mirror-like finish, and non-magnetic properties in the annealed condition—making it the go-to choice for automotive trim, railway cars, kitchen appliances and architectural panels. When you **buy 204 stainless steel sheet** from trusted **204 stainless steel sheet suppliers**, you save up to 35 % versus 304 while meeting ASTM, EN and JIS standards.

## What is 204 Stainless Steel Sheet?  
**204 stainless steel sheet** is a lean-alloy austenitic grade in which manganese and nitrogen replace part of the nickel, yielding higher strength and a more stable **204 stainless steel sheet price**. The higher nitrogen content (0.20–0.30 %) boosts tensile and yield strengths without sacrificing ductility or corrosion resistance in mild environments. Compared with 201/201L, grade 204 contains more chromium and nickel, offering better pitting resistance; against 304, it provides comparable corrosion performance in urban atmospheres while costing 20–25 % less.

## Key Advantages of 204 Stainless Steel Sheet

- **30–40 % Higher Yield Strength** than 304 → lighter gauges, lower material cost.  
- **Lower & More Stable Price** – Reduced nickel content shields you from LME volatility.  
- **Excellent Deep Drawing** – BA coils can be drawn into complex sink bowls without edge cracking.  
- **Good Corrosion Resistance** – Handles urban atmospheres, mild acids and cleaning agents.  
- **Non-Magnetic in Annealed Condition** – Ideal for electronic housings and MRI-compatible fixtures.  
- **Wide Finish Portfolio** – From matte 2B to super-mirror 8K, embossed or anti-fingerprint.

## Applications & Industries

- **Automotive Trim & Structural Parts:** Door frames, trunk lids, exhaust heat-shields; 390 MPa yield allows thinner, lighter sections.  
- **Railway & Subway Car Bodies:** Side walls and roof skins benefit from high strength-to-weight ratio and bright BA finish.  
- **Kitchen Equipment:** Deep-drawn BA coils for cookware, refrigerator doors and dishwasher panels that resist tomato acids.  
- **Cookware & Utensils:** Pots, pans and steamers with mirror polish pass 500-hour neutral salt-spray tests.  
- **Architectural Panels & Elevator Doors:** 8K mirror or hair-line HL finishes create luxury aesthetics without luxury cost.  
- **Tubes and Pipes:** Strip is roll-formed and HF-welded into structural square tubes for handrails and display racks.  
- **Consumer Electronics Housings:** Non-magnetic, fingerprint-resistant coatings keep laptops and TV frames looking pristine.

## Manufacturing Process & Quality Assurance

1. **Electric-Arc Furnace Melting** – Scrap and alloying elements melted under argon shielding.  
2. **Continuous Casting** – 200 mm slabs cast for uniform chemistry and minimal inclusions.  
3. **Hot Rolling** – Reheat to 1,220 °C and roll to 3–12 mm plate or 2–3 mm transfer bar.  
4. **Cold Rolling** – Transfer bar reduced to 0.3–3 mm at 20 °C with ±0.02 mm thickness tolerance.  
5. **Bright Annealing** – 1,100 °C in hydrogen atmosphere for mirror BA finish and restored corrosion resistance.  
6. **Finishing** – Skin-pass for 2B, polish lines for No.4/HL, super-polish for 8K mirror or embossed patterns.  
7. **Quality Control** – Spectrometer, ultrasonic thickness, and ASTM tensile tests ensure every **204 stainless steel sheet** meets specification before packing.

## Maintenance & Cleaning Guide

- **Routine Cleaning:** Warm water + mild detergent, soft cloth, rinse and dry to prevent water spots.  
- **Fingerprint Removal:** 1 % vinegar solution, wipe along grain, buff with microfiber cloth.  
- **Avoid:** Chloride bleach, hydrochloric acid, steel wool or abrasive powders that can pit the surface.  
- **Storage:** Elevate on wooden pallets, cover with breathable PE film, keep away from moisture and carbon steel dust.  
- **Passivation:** Optional citric acid bath after fabrication to remove free iron and enhance **204 stainless steel properties**.

**Q2:** Is 204 stainless steel magnetic?  
**A:** Essentially non-magnetic in the annealed condition; slight magnetism may appear after severe cold working.

**Q3:** Can 204 stainless steel sheet be used for food contact?  
**A:** Yes, it meets FDA and GB 4806.9 requirements for non-acidic food contact; widely used for cookware and worktops.

**Q4:** Why is 204 cheaper than 304?  
**A:** Lower nickel content reduces raw-material cost and shields buyers from volatile LME nickel prices.

**Q5:** What is the maximum temperature 204 stainless steel can withstand?  
**A:** Continuous service up to 650 °C; intermittent up to 800 °C without scaling.

**Q6:** Do you supply BA or 8K mirror finish?  
**A:** Absolutely – BA, 8K, embossed, anti-fingerprint or PVC film applied in-house.

**Q7:** How fast can you deliver to the USA?
