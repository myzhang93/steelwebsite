## Introduction  
When your project demands the ultimate combination of strength, corrosion resistance and ductility, **209 stainless steel coil** (UNS S20910, Nitronic® 50, XM-19) stands alone. This nitrogen-strengthened austenitic grade achieves twice the yield strength of 316L while maintaining full non-magnetic properties and superior pitting resistance in seawater. From offshore pump shafts to aerospace fasteners, **209 stainless steel coil** gives you near-duplex performance without the welding headaches. Discover why leading **209 stainless steel coil suppliers** worldwide are switching to genuine Nitronic 50 for mission-critical applications.

## What is 209 Stainless Steel Coil? (Nitronic 50 / XM-19 / UNS S20910)  
**209 stainless steel coil** is a high-nitrogen, manganese-rich austenitic alloy originally developed for marine fasteners. Its balanced chromium (20–23 %) and molybdenum (1.5–3.0 %) provides pitting resistance comparable to 316L, while 0.15–0.40 % nitrogen boosts yield strength above 55 ksi (380 MPa)—far exceeding conventional austenitic grades. Unlike duplex alloys, Nitronic 50 remains fully austenitic after heavy cold work, ensuring non-magnetic properties essential for electronics and MRI equipment. Compared with 316L, 904L, 2205 duplex or AL-6XN, **209 stainless steel properties** include better impact toughness at cryogenic temperatures and simpler welding without post-weld heat treatment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1:** What is the difference between 209 and 316L stainless steel coil?  
**A:** 209 (Nitronic 50) offers twice the yield strength, better pitting resistance (PREN 34) and remains non-magnetic, while 316L has lower alloy cost but cannot match strength or galling resistance.

**Q2:** Is 209 stainless steel coil (Nitronic 50) magnetic?  
**A:** Essentially non-magnetic; permeability &lt;1.005 even after severe cold working.

**Q3:** Can 209 withstand continuous seawater exposure?  
**A:** Yes, PREN ≈ 34, proven 10-year immersion tests at 30 °C without pitting; outperforms 316L in ASTM G48.

**Q4:** What welding filler should be used for 209 coil?  
**A:** Use ER209 (AWS A5.9) or commercially “Nitronic 50” filler; no pre-heat or post-weld heat treatment required.

**Q5:** What is the maximum service temperature?  
**A:** Continuous 400 °C; intermittent 800 °C without scaling; cryogenic -196 °C with high impact toughness.

**Q6:** Why is 209 more expensive than standard grades?  
**A:** Higher alloy content (Cr, Mo, N) and specialized melting raise cost, but strength gain allows thinner sections, often reducing total project cost.

**Q7:** Do you supply **Nitronic 50 coil** in custom slit widths?  
**A:** Absolutely – precision slitting 20–2000 mm with ±0.02 mm tolerance and oscillation winding for long runs.
