## Introduction  
Searching for stainless fittings that outperform 201 in strength yet undercut 304 in price? **204 stainless steel fittings** (UNS S20400) are your answer. This nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic grade delivers 30–40 % higher yield strength than 304 while slashing material cost by 35–45 %. From mirror-polished handrail elbows to deep-drawn tee reducers, **204 stainless steel fittings** keep high-speed presses running and architectural budgets healthy. Discover why leading **204 stainless steel fittings suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-duty fluid systems.

## What are 204 Stainless Steel Fittings? (UNS S20400)  
**204 stainless steel fittings** are nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic components that maintain full non-magnetic properties and excellent formability. The balanced chromium (15–17 %) and manganese (7–9 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while nitrogen (0.15–0.35 %) boosts yield strength above 350 MPa—far exceeding 304-cost ratios. Compared with 201/201L, grade 204 offers higher chromium and nickel, giving better pitting resistance; against 301, it provides superior corrosion performance and lower price volatility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1:** What is the difference between 204 and 304 stainless steel fittings?  
**A:** 204 uses manganese and nitrogen to replace most nickel, giving 30–40 % higher yield strength and 35–45 % lower cost, with similar urban corrosion resistance.

**Q2:** Is 204 stainless steel fittings food-safe or potable water approved?  
**A:** Yes, they meet FDA and GB 4806.9 for non-acidic potable water and food contact where chloride &lt;50 ppm.

**Q3:** Can 204 fittings be used outdoors?  
**A:** Suitable in urban or low-chloride environments; for coastal salt-spray, 316L is recommended.

**Q4:** Is 204 stainless steel magnetic?  
**A:** Essentially non-magnetic in annealed condition; permeability &lt;1.005 even after cold forming.

**Q5:** Why are 204 fittings significantly cheaper than 304?  
**A:** Reduced nickel raw-material cost and more stable alloy pricing shield buyers from LME nickel volatility.

**Q6:** Is 204 stronger than 201/201L stainless steel?  
**A:** Yes, 204 offers ~15 % higher yield strength and better corrosion resistance due to higher chromium and nitrogen content.

**Q7:** What welding filler is recommended for 204 fittings?  
**A:** ER308L is compatible; for color match use ER204 or ER309L; no pre-heat or post-weld heat treatment required.
