# 201 Stainless Steel Plate – Cost-Effective, Corrosion-Resistant Sheet for Every Industry

## Introduction  
When you need a stainless sheet that looks premium but fits a tight budget, **201 stainless steel plate** is the answer. Thanks to a low-nickel, high-manganese austenitic blend, grade 201 delivers tensile strength 10 % higher than 304 while costing 20-25 % less—making it the first choice for contractors, kitchen builders, and automotive stylists who want 304-like shine without the price spike. Its 17 % chromium skin resists urban corrosion, mild acids, and everyday abrasion, yet the alloy remains formable, weldable, and mirror-polish friendly. From elevator cabins to truck trailers, specifying **201 stainless steel plate** keeps your project on budget and on time, especially when you buy from experienced **201 2b finish stainless steel plate suppliers** who stock full-size sheets ready for immediate dispatch.

## Key Features & Benefits  
- **Lean Alloy, Lower Cost** – Reduced nickel keeps the alloy surcharge low, stabilising your project budget compared with 304 or 316.  
- **Higher Strength** – Manganese and nitrogen boost yield strength to ≥310 MPa, allowing thinner gauges and lighter structures.  
- **Excellent Deep Drawability** – **201 ba stainless steel plate** can be drawn into complex sink bowls or door skins without edge cracking.  
- **Wide Finish Portfolio** – Choose 2B for industrial panels, BA for mirror reflectivity, No.1 for heavy-duty **201 hot rolled stainless steel plates**, or diamond-pattern **201 stainless steel checker plate** for anti-slip flooring.  
- **Superior Weldability** – Low carbon (&lt;0.08 %) eliminates carbide precipitation; TIG, MIG, laser, or resistance welding all pass AWS D1.6 without post-weld annealing.  
- **Anti-Fingerprint Coating** – Optional nano-clear layer resists smudges on elevator and façade panels, cutting maintenance by 50 %.  
- **Hot or Cold Rolled Options** – **201 hot rolled stainless steel plates** from 3 mm to 100 mm for heavy structural jobs; cold rolled below 3 mm for precision fabrication.  
- **100 % Recyclable** – Meets ISO 14021 environmental claims, supporting LEED credits and green-building certifications.

## Applications  
Interior designers choose **201 ba stainless steel plate** for mirror-finish elevator cabins and reception desks that wow visitors without blowing the budget. Food-service fabricators deep-draw 2B sheets into commercial kitchen sinks, counters and splashbacks that pass sanitary inspections while resisting tomato acids and cleaning chemicals. Automotive plants specify **201 hot rolled stainless steel plates** for heavy-duty truck floors and trailer walls, benefiting from strength and weight savings. Architects panel façade soffits with embossed sheets, while industrial engineers deploy **201 stainless steel checker plate** on stairs, platforms and loading bays for slip-resistant safety. Retail stores use hair-line sheets for display tables, and rail-car builders adopt it for interior wall cladding, all taking advantage of the steady **201 stainless steel plate for sale** pricing from a reliable **201 stainless steel plate source**.

## Why Choose 201 Stainless Steel Plate  
Compared with 304, **201 stainless steel plate** offers virtually identical tensile strength and a similar bright finish, yet saves 20-25 % on alloy cost—money you can redirect into fabrication or faster delivery. The higher manganese content increases work-hardening rate, making **201 ba stainless steel plate** ideal for deep-drawn parts like kitchen sinks or embossed elevator doors. For heavy structural applications, **201 hot rolled stainless steel plates** provide the same weld integrity as 304 but at a lower weight per square metre. Leading **201 2b finish stainless steel plate suppliers** also highlight the grade’s stable nickel content, which keeps the **201 stainless steel plate for sale** price predictable across long-term projects. When your environment is non-marine and aesthetics matter, 201 gives you 304-like prestige without the premium.
