## Introduction  
Searching for stainless fittings that look like 304 but cost like 201? **201 stainless steel fittings** (UNS S20100) are your answer. This high-manganese, low-nickel austenitic grade delivers excellent cold forming, mirror-polish brightness and sufficient corrosion resistance for decorative, structural and light-duty fluid systems—while slashing material cost by 30–45 %. From handrail elbows to food-conveyor tees, **201 stainless steel fittings** keep budgets healthy and lines running. Discover why leading **201 stainless steel fittings suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for continuous stamping, laser welding and architectural finishing.

## What are 201 Stainless Steel Fittings? (UNS S20100)  
**201 stainless steel fittings** are high-manganese, low-nickel austenitic components that maintain full non-magnetic properties and excellent formability. The balanced chromium (16–18 %) and manganese (7.5–10 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while nitrogen (≤0.25 %) boosts yield strength above 310 MPa—far exceeding conventional 304-cost ratios. Compared with 304, 316, or 201L, **201 stainless steel properties** include better work-hardening rate and price stability, making them the first choice for cost-conscious projects that still demand 304-like aesthetics.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1:** What is the difference between 201 and 304 stainless steel fittings?  
**A:** 201 uses manganese and nitrogen to replace most nickel, giving 30–45 % lower cost and similar urban corrosion resistance, but slightly less pitting resistance than 304.

**Q2:** Are 201 stainless steel fittings food safe?  
**A:** Yes, they meet FDA and GB 4806.9 for non-acidic food contact; widely used for display racks and conveyor frames.

**Q3:** Can 201 fittings be used outdoors?  
**A:** Suitable in urban or low-chloride environments; for coastal salt-spray, 316 is recommended.

**Q4:** Are 201 stainless steel fittings magnetic?  
**A:** Essentially non-magnetic in annealed condition; permeability &lt;1.005 even after cold forming.

**Q5:** Why are 201 fittings so much cheaper than 304?  
**A:** Reduced nickel raw-material cost and more stable alloy pricing shield buyers from LME nickel volatility.

**Q6:** Can 201 fittings be welded with 308L filler?  
**A:** Yes, ER308L is compatible; for color match use ER201L or ER309L.

**Q7:** Do you supply **201 stainless steel fittings** in custom angles?
