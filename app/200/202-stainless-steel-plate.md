# 202 Stainless Steel Plate – High-Strength, Budget-Smart Alternative to 304

## Introduction  
If you need an austenitic stainless sheet that combines 304-like corrosion resistance with a friendlier price tag, **202 stainless steel plate** is the answer. By replacing part of the nickel with manganese and nitrogen, grade 202 delivers tensile strength 10–15 % higher than 304 while cutting alloy cost by 20–25 %. Its 17–19 % chromium envelope resists urban atmospheres, mild acids and cleaning chemicals, making it a favourite for elevator cabins, kitchen equipment, automotive trim and architectural wall panels. With excellent deep-drawing, welding and polishing characteristics, **china 202 stainless steel plate** has become the go-to economical grade for contractors, fabricators and OEMs across Asia, the Middle East and the Americas who want reliable performance without nickel-price volatility.

## Key Features & Benefits  
- **Lean Austenitic Chemistry** – Mn 7.5–10 % & N 0.25 % max stabilise austenite while reducing nickel dependency, keeping the **202 stainless steel plate price** low and predictable.  
- **Higher Cold-Work Strength** – Yield ≥320 MPa allows thinner gauges, lighter truck bodies and reduced freight cost.  
- **Wide Finish Range** – Cold-rolled 2B for industrial panels, BA for mirror reflectivity, No.1 for heavy-duty hot-rolled plates, No.4 satin, HL hair-line, 8K mirror and embossed patterns for designer façades.  
- **Excellent Deep-Drawability** – **202 stainless steel plate** can be drawn into complex sink bowls, elevator door skins and automotive trim without edge cracking or orange-peel.  
- **Superior Weldability** – Low carbon (&lt;0.08 %) prevents carbide precipitation; TIG, MIG, laser and resistance welding all pass AWS D1.6 without post-weld anneal.  
- **Hot & Cold Rolled Options** – Cold-rolled 0.3–3 mm for precision fabrication; **202 hot rolled stainless steel plates** 3–100 mm for heavy structural flooring and tank heads.  
- **Magnetic Response** – Slightly magnetic after severe cold working, allowing magnetic handling in automated lines while retaining corrosion resistance.  
- **100 % Recyclable** – Meets ISO 14021 environmental claims, supporting LEED points and green-building certifications.

## Applications  
**202 stainless steel plate** is found wherever appearance, strength and cost must coexist. Food-service factories deep-draw 2B sheets into commercial kitchen sinks, countertops and backsplash panels that resist tomato acids and daily scrubbing. Elevator and escalator makers specify BA or 8K mirror sheets for cabin walls, door skins and ceiling panels, achieving luxury reflectivity at a fraction of 304 cost. Automotive tier-1 suppliers stamp cold-rolled coils into trunk lids, trim mouldings and exhaust heat-shields, capitalising on the alloy’s 650 °C oxidation resistance. Architectural projects from Mumbai airports to Dubai metro stations use hair-line or embossed **china 202 stainless steel plate** for wall cladding, column covers and soffit panels. Railway coach builders adopt it for interior seat frames and luggage racks, while storage-tank fabricators choose hot-rolled No.1 plates for non-corrosive chemical containers. In retail stores, satin-finish 202 sheets form display tables and signage, proving that style and savings can share the same surface.

## Why Choose 202 Stainless Steel Plate  
Compared with 201, grade 202 offers an extra 1–2 % chromium and higher nickel, giving markedly better corrosion resistance while maintaining the economic edge. Against 304, 202 sacrifices only marginal chloride performance yet saves 20–25 % on the **202 stainless steel plate price**—budget that can be reinvested in polishing, bending or faster delivery. Its higher work-hardening rate allows thinner sheets, reducing weight and freight cost. Leading **202 stainless steel plate manufacturers** also praise the alloy’s stable manganese/nickel balance, ensuring consistent mechanical properties across 1–12 m coil or sheet lengths. Whether you need mirror-clad elevator walls or heavy-gauge tank heads, **202 stainless steel plate** gives you 304-like prestige with 201-like cost efficiency.
