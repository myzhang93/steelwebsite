## Introduction  
Searching for a stainless pipe that deep-draws like 304 but costs like 201? **201L stainless steel pipe** (UNS S20103) is your answer. This extra-low-carbon, manganese-nitrogen strengthened austenitic grade delivers 304-like formability and urban corrosion resistance while slashing material cost by 25–35 %. From furniture handrails to light-duty water lines, **201L stainless steel pipe** keeps budgets healthy and lines running. Discover why leading **201L stainless steel pipe suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-fluid applications.

## What is 201L Stainless Steel Pipe? (UNS S20103)  
**201L stainless steel pipe** is the extra-low-carbon version of grade 201 (≤0.03 % C), minimizing carbide precipitation during welding and severe cold forming. High manganese (7.5–10 %) and nitrogen (≤0.25 %) maintain a fully austenitic structure, giving **201L stainless steel properties** comparable to 304 for urban corrosion, deep drawing and mirror polishing—yet at a fraction of the nickel cost. Compared with 201, 201L offers better weld corrosion resistance; against 304/304L, it provides similar strength and formability while costing 25–35 % less.
