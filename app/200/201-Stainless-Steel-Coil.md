**Q4. How do you control surface quality?**  
A4. Each coil runs through online roughness meter and automatic defect mapping; PVC film is applied immediately after final polishing.

**Q5. Which certificate do you provide?**  
A5. Mill test certificate per EN 10204 3.1, SGS third-party inspection, ISO 9001, CE, RoHS, REACH as requested.

**Q6. How long is your lead time?**  
A6. 7-10 days for stock sizes; 20-25 days for non-stock or custom colored/embossed orders.

**Q7. Can you supply slit coils or blanks?**  
A7. Yes, width 20-1 600 mm, ID 508/610 mm, weight 3-25 MT per coil; precise blanking up to 4 × 2 m.

**Q8. Do you offer a price guarantee?**  
A8. We lock the price for 30 days after PI is signed, protecting customers from nickel volatility.

**Q9. What surface protection do you use for colored coils?**  
A9. 70 µm laser PVC plus foam board between each coil to avoid scratching during long ocean freight.

**Q10. Is OEM branding available?**
