From mirror-polished handrails to deep-drawn automotive exhausts, **202 stainless steel tube** keeps high-speed presses running and architectural budgets healthy. Discover why leading **202 stainless steel tube suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-duty fluid applications.

## What is 202 Stainless Steel Tube? (UNS S20200)  
**202 stainless steel tube** is a nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic grade that maintains a fully austenitic structure for excellent formability and non-magnetic properties. The balanced chromium (17–19 %) and manganese (7.5–10 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while nitrogen (≤0.25 %) boosts yield strength above 350 MPa—far exceeding 304-cost ratios. Compared with 201, 202 offers higher chromium and nickel, giving better pitting resistance; against 304/304L, it provides similar strength and formability while costing 30–40 % less.
