Searching for a stainless pipe that stamps like 304 but costs like 201? **204 stainless steel pipe** (UNS S20400) is your answer. This nitrogen-strengthened, manganese-rich austenitic grade delivers 30–40 % higher yield strength than 304 while slashing material cost by 25–35 %. From furniture handrails to automotive exhaust, **204 stainless steel pipe** keeps high-speed presses running and budgets healthy. Discover why leading **204 stainless steel pipe suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for decorative, structural and light-fluid applications.

## What is 204 Stainless Steel Pipe? (UNS S20400)  
**204 stainless steel pipe** is a high-nitrogen, low-nickel austenitic grade that maintains a fully austenitic structure for excellent formability and non-magnetic properties. The balanced chromium (15–17 %) and manganese (7–9 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while 0.15–0.35 % nitrogen boosts yield strength above 350 MPa—far exceeding 304. Compared with 201/201L, grade 204 offers higher chromium and nickel, giving better pitting resistance; against 301, it provides superior corrosion performance and lower price volatility.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q1:** What is the difference between 204 and 304 stainless steel pipe?  
**A:** 204 uses manganese and nitrogen to replace most nickel, giving 30–40 % higher yield strength and 25–35 % lower cost, with similar corrosion resistance in mild environments.

**Q2:** Is 204 stainless steel pipe magnetic?  
**A:** Essentially non-magnetic in the annealed condition; permeability &lt;1.005 even after cold bending.

**Q3:** Can 204 pipe be used for drinking water or food contact?  
**A:** Yes, it meets FDA and GB 4806.9 for non-acidic potable water and food contact where chloride &lt;50 ppm.

**Q4:** Why is 204 pipe significantly cheaper than 304?  
**A:** Reduced nickel raw-material cost and more stable alloy pricing shield buyers from LME nickel volatility.

**Q5:** Is 204 suitable for outdoor applications?  
**A:** Suitable in urban or low-chloride environments; for coastal salt-spray, 316 is recommended.
