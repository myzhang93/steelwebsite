# 209 Stainless Steel Tube – The Ultimate High-Strength, Corrosion-Resistant Solution for Offshore and High-Pressure Applications

When your project demands twice the strength of 316L and full resistance to marine chlorides, **209 Stainless Steel Tube** (UNS S20910, Nitronic 50, XM-19) is the only logical choice. This nitrogen-strengthened austenitic grade delivers yield strength up to 100 ksi (690 MPa) while maintaining excellent ductility, full non-magnetic properties down to –196 °C, and superior resistance to sulfide stress cracking. Whether you are building subsea umbilicals, high-pressure hydraulic lines, or downhole tools, **209 stainless steel tube** offers the strength, fatigue life, and corrosion resistance that 316L simply cannot match—without the cost penalty of duplex or nickel-base alloys.
