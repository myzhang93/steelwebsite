From deep-drawn cookware to automotive trim, **204 stainless steel coil** keeps high-speed presses running and budgets healthy. Discover why leading **204 stainless steel coil suppliers** worldwide are switching to this lean-alloy powerhouse for continuous stamping, laser welding and mirror-polish finishing.

## What is 204 Stainless Steel Coil? (UNS S20400)  
**204 stainless steel coil** is a high-nitrogen, low-nickel austenitic grade that maintains a fully austenitic structure for excellent formability and non-magnetic properties. The balanced chromium (17–19 %) and manganese (7.5–10 %) content provides urban corrosion resistance, while 0.20–0.30 % nitrogen boosts yield strength above 350 MPa—far exceeding 304. Compared with 201/201L, grade 204 offers higher chromium and nickel, giving better pitting resistance; against 301, it provides superior corrosion performance and lower price volatility.

## Key Advantages of 204 Stainless Steel Coil

- **30–40 % Higher Yield Strength** than 304 → thinner gauges, lighter components, lower freight cost.  
- **Significantly Lower & More Stable Price** – Reduced nickel content shields you from LME volatility; lower **204 stainless steel coil price**.  
- **Outstanding Formability & Deep Drawing** – High n-value and r-value reduce breakage in complex cookware draws.  
- **Good Corrosion Resistance** – Handles urban atmospheres, mild acids and cleaning chemicals; passes 500-hour neutral salt-spray.  
- **Non-Magnetic in Annealed Condition** – Ideal for electronics, MRI-compatible fixtures and decorative appliances.  
- **Continuous Stamping Friendly** – Uniform mechanical properties across 25-ton coils keep high-speed presses running smoothly.

## Wide Applications

- **Cookware & Kitchen Utensils:** Deep-drawn **204 coil for deep drawing** – pots, steamers, sink bowls with mirror BA finish.  
- **Household Appliances:** Washing-machine drums, dishwasher panels, microwave interiors; bright annealed surface resists detergent attack.  
- **Automotive Trim & Exhaust:** Non-magnetic door frames, trunk lids, tail-pipe resonators; 350 MPa yield allows down-gauging for weight savings.  
- **Tubes, Pipes & Flexible Hoses:** Roll-formed and HF-welded into decorative round/square tubes for furniture and handrails.  
- **Elevator Cabins & Doors:** 8K mirror or hair-line HL finishes create luxury aesthetics without luxury cost.  
- **Architectural Decoration & Signage:** Embossed or anti-fingerprint coils for façade panels, column covers, signage boxes.
