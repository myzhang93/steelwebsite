## FAQs

**Q1. Is 202 stainless steel coil magnetic?**  
A1. It is non-magnetic after solution annealing (μr &lt; 1.02); slight magnetism may appear after cold working.

**Q2. Can I use 202 coil in coastal areas?**  
A2. Yes for light coastal or indoor marine environments. For heavy salt-spray zones we recommend 316L or apply a PVD coating on 202 for extra protection.

**Q3. What is the minimum order quantity?**  
A3. 1 x 20 GP container (≈ 20 MT) for mill finish; 50 sheets for colored or embossed finish.

**Q4. How do you control surface quality?**  
A4. Each coil runs through online roughness meter and automatic defect mapping; PVC film is applied immediately after final polishing.

**Q5. Which certificate do you provide?**  
A5. Mill test certificate per EN 10204 3.1, SGS third-party inspection, ISO 9001, CE, RoHS, REACH as requested.

**Q6. How long is your lead time?**  
A6. 7-10 days for stock sizes; 20-25 days for non-stock or custom colored/embossed orders.

**Q7. Can you supply slit coils or blanks?**  
A7. Yes, width 20-1 600 mm, ID 508/610 mm, weight 3-25 MT per coil; precise blanking up to 4 × 2 m.

**Q8. Do you offer a price guarantee?**  
A8. We lock the price for 30 days after PI is signed, protecting customers from nickel volatility.
