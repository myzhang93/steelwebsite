# 204 Stainless Steel Tube – The Ultimate High-Strength, Low-Nickel Alternative for Structural & Decorative Tubing

When your project demands 304-like aesthetics at 30–40 % lower cost, **204 Stainless Steel Tube** delivers. Grade 204 (UNS S20400, also marketed as Nitronic 30) replaces much of the expensive nickel with manganese and nitrogen, achieving a minimum yield strength of 380 MPa—50–80 % higher than 304—while maintaining excellent ductility and formability. The result is a tube that is lighter, stronger, and significantly cheaper, making **204 stainless steel tube** the perfect “304 replacement” for decorative handrails, automotive trim, bus frames, and light structural applications where maximum strength-to-weight and cost savings are critical.
