# Stainless Steel in Water Treatment – Corrosion Resistance and Long-Term Performance

Stainless steel is essential in water treatment systems due to its resistance to corrosion from water, chlorine, chloramines, and aggressive chemicals. It is used in potable water, wastewater, desalination, and industrial water treatment applications.

### Why Stainless Steel is Preferred in Water Treatment

1. **Corrosion Resistance**  
   Resists pitting, crevice corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking.

2. **Hygienic and Non-Toxic**  
   No leaching of harmful substances into water.

3. **Long Service Life**  
   Decades of reliable performance with minimal maintenance.

4. **High Strength**  
   Withstands high pressures in pipes and vessels.

### Common Grades

- **316L / 316Ti**: Most common for potable and wastewater.
- **Duplex 2205 / 2507**: High-chloride environments (e.g., desalination).
- **904L**: Severe corrosion conditions.
- **304**: Less aggressive water treatment.

### Surface Finishes

- **2B & BA**: Internal surfaces.
- **Electropolished**: Ultra-smooth for high-purity water.

### Key Applications

1. **Piping and Fittings**  
   Distribution networks and process piping.

2. **Storage Tanks and Reservoirs**  
   Potable water and chemical storage.

3. **Desalination Plants**  
   Reverse osmosis vessels and brine handling.

4. **Filters and Strainers**  
   Housing and media support.

5. **Pumps and Valves**  
   Bodies, impellers, and valve components.

6. **UV and Ozone Systems**  
   Reactor chambers.

7. **Membrane Housings**  
   RO and UF systems.

8. **Wastewater Treatment**  
   Aeration tanks and clarifiers.

9. **Chemical Dosing Systems**  
   Tanks and injectors.

10. **Swimming Pool and Spa Equipment**  
    Filtration systems and heat exchangers.

### Design and Fabrication

- Full penetration welds.
- Passivation and electropolishing.
- Material certificates and traceability.

### Maintenance

- Periodic cleaning and passivation.
- Inspection for pitting in high-chloride environments.

Stainless steel ensures safe, reliable, and long-lasting water treatment systems worldwide.
