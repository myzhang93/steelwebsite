# Stainless Steel in Chemical Processing – Corrosion Resistance and Safety

Stainless steel is a cornerstone of the chemical processing industry, providing exceptional resistance to a wide range of corrosive chemicals, acids, alkalis, and high temperatures. It ensures safety, product purity, and equipment longevity in demanding chemical environments.

### Why Stainless Steel is Critical in Chemical Processing

1. **Broad Corrosion Resistance**  
   Resists organic and inorganic acids, chlorides, and solvents.

2. **High-Temperature Capability**  
   Maintains strength and oxidation resistance.

3. **Non-Reactive**  
   Does not contaminate products.

4. **Pressure Resistance**  
   Suitable for high-pressure reactors and vessels.

### Common Grades

- **316L**: General chemical service.
- **904L**: Severe acid environments.
- **Alloy 20**: Sulfuric acid.
- **Duplex 2205 / 2507**: High-chloride and stress corrosion cracking resistance.
- **Alloy 625 / 825**: Extreme corrosion conditions.

### Surface Finishes

- **Electropolished**: For ultra-pure applications.
- **2B & BA**: Standard internal surfaces.

### Key Applications

1. **Reactors and Pressure Vessels**  
   Batch and continuous reactors.

2. **Storage Tanks**  
   Acid, alkali, and solvent storage.

3. **Piping and Piping Systems**  
   Process and transfer lines.

4. **Heat Exchangers**  
   Shell-and-tube and plate exchangers.

5. **Columns and Distillation Towers**  
   Packing supports and trays.

6. **Pumps and Valves**  
   Bodies and internals.

7. **Filtration and Separation Equipment**  
   Filters, centrifuges, and separators.

8. **Mixers and Agitators**  
   Shafts, impellers, and vessels.

9. **Pharmaceutical Processing**  
   High-purity equipment.

10. **Specialty Chemicals**  
    High-temperature and high-pressure applications.

### Design and Safety Considerations

- Full material traceability.
- Radiographic weld inspection.
- Pressure vessel design codes (ASME, PED).
- Corrosion allowance and inspection ports.

### Maintenance

- Regular passivation.
- Non-destructive testing (ultrasonic, dye penetrant).
- Periodic replacement based on corrosion monitoring.

Stainless steel ensures safe, reliable, and efficient chemical processing operations worldwide.
