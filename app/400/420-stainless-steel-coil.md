# 420 Stainless Steel Coil – Ultra-Hard Martensitic Precision for Surgical Blades & Cutting Tools

## Introduction  
When a medical-device OEM needs **420 stainless steel coil** that can be stamped, heat-treated and polished into 58 HRC scalpels, only a **martensitic 420 stainless steel coil** with precise carbon control and ultra-clean surface will pass FDA validation. Unlike austenitic grades, **high carbon 420 stainless steel coil** transforms into a hard, wear-resistant martensite after quench and temper, delivering the highest hardness of any stainless strip or **420 stainless steel strip** in high-volume coil form—yet still corrosion-resistant enough for autoclave cycles. From Swiss cutlery blanks to industrial shear knives, engineers choose **420 stainless steel coil suppliers** who can guarantee tight chemistry, slit-width tolerance ±0.02 mm and full **quenched and tempered 420 stainless steel coil** processing under one roof. This page gives you the complete **420 stainless steel coil data sheet**, comparative tables and **420 stainless steel coil price** intelligence you need—while positioning us, undisputedly, as the **best 420 stainless steel coil distributor** on the planet.

1. **Preheat**: 600 °C to equalize, especially for heavy gauge &gt;1 mm.  
2. **Austenitize**: 980–1 050 °C (oil quench thin &lt;0.1 mm; air blast ≥0.5 mm).  
3. **Cryogenic** (optional): –80 °C for 2 h to transform retained austenite, adds +1–2 HRC.  
4. **Temper**: 150 °C for 58 HRC razor blades; 250 °C for 55 HRC surgical scissors; 380 °C for 50 HRC springs needing toughness.  
5. **Surface finish**: after temper, polish to mirror to remove oxide and improve corrosion. Our in-house continuous hardening furnace processes 2 000 tons of **quenched and tempered 420 stainless steel coil** per month—lead time 7 days.
