**Meta Description:** 446 stainless steel pipe seamless/welded 25% Cr, 1150 °C scaling resistance, best 446 stainless steel pipe price from global supplier. Data sheet, specs, stock.

## Introduction – Why 446 Stainless Steel Pipe Becomes the Go-To Ferritic Hero Above 1000 °C

When a cement kiln in Egypt needed radiant tubing that could survive 1120 °C flue gas for five years straight, engineers skipped 310 and specified **446 stainless steel pipe**. The reason? This **ferritic 446 stainless steel pipe** offers the **highest oxidation resistance** of any ferritic grade—**1150 °C continuous, 1200 °C intermittent**—while costing **30-50% less** than nickel-rich austenitic alternatives. With **25% chromium**, the **446 stainless steel oxidation resistance pipe** forms a tight Cr₂O₃ scale that regrows after spallation, giving furnace OEMs, refinery heaters and glass lehrs unprecedented uptime. Unlike 310, **446 stainless steel seamless pipe** exhibits **lower thermal expansion** (10.4 µm/m·K), reducing thermal-fatigue cracks in cyclic duty. From **schedule 40 446 stainless steel pipe** in pyrolysis heaters to 8″ EFW recuperator coils, this **high-temperature 446 stainless steel pipe** resists sulfidation, carburization and molten chloride salts, making it the **best 446 stainless steel pipe distributor** choice for aggressive heat. Our company stocks 8,000+ tons, provides full **446 stainless steel pipe data sheet** certifications, and guarantees the **most competitive 446 stainless steel pipe price** on the planet. Read the technical tables below, download the scaling curves, and discover why **446 vs 310 vs 309 stainless steel pipe** comparisons always end with 446.
