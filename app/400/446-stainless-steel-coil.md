# 446 Stainless Steel Coil – Ultimate 1150 °C Heat-Resistant Ferritic Alloy for High-Temperature Furnaces

## Introduction  
When a furnace OEM needs a material that survives 1100 °C for 20,000 h without spalling, only **446 stainless steel coil** delivers continuous **oxidation resistance** at one-third the cost of 310. With **25% chromium**, ferritic structure and zero nickel, **high-temperature 446 stainless steel coil** forms a tenacious Cr₂O₃ scale that self-heals in air, carburising and sulfidising atmospheres. Unlike austenitic 310/309, **heat-resistant 446 stainless steel coil** exhibits lower thermal expansion, no sigma-phase transformation and instant availability from stock. This page gives engineers, buyers and designers every specification, comparison and **446 stainless steel data sheet** figure required to specify **ferritic 446 stainless steel coil** with confidence—while proving we are the planet’s **best 446 stainless steel coil distributor**.

**Q4: Can 446 coil be welded?**  
A4: Yes, use AWS E/ER 310 or 309L filler; preheat 150 °C, keep inter-pass ≤200 °C to limit grain growth.

**Q5: Does 446 suffer sigma phase embrittlement?**  
A5: Sigma forms &lt;700 °C after 1000 h; cooling above 900 °C dissolves it—no risk in service window.

**Q6: Minimum order quantity for 446 coil?**  
A6: 50 kg for slit width ex-stock; 2 tons for custom hot-rolled coil.

**Q7: Typical lead time?**  
A7: 3 days for stock sizes; 10 days for pickled 2B 0.5–2 mm; 15 days for 8 mm No.1.

**Q8: Creep strength at 900 °C?**  
A8: 18 MPa for 10,000 h rupture—sufficient for most furnace fixtures.
