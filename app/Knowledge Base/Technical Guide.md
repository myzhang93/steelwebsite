# Stainless Steel Technical Guide – Properties, Standards, and Best Practices

This technical guide provides in-depth information on the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of stainless steel, along with international standards, testing methods, and engineering best practices. It serves as a reference for designers, fabricators, and end-users to ensure proper specification and performance.

### Physical Properties of Stainless Steel

- **Density**: 7.7–8.0 g/cm³ (slightly less than carbon steel).
- **Melting Point**: 1375–1530°C depending on grade.
- **Thermal Conductivity**: 14–19 W/m·K (lower than carbon steel).
- **Coefficient of Thermal Expansion**: 16–18 × 10⁻⁶ /°C (higher than carbon steel).
- **Electrical Resistivity**: 70–85 μΩ·cm (higher than carbon steel).
- **Magnetic Properties**: Austenitic grades non-magnetic; ferritic and martensitic magnetic.

|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Tensile Strength (MPa)    | 515–620        | 515–690        | 620–900       | 700–1300       |
| Yield Strength (MPa)      | 205–310        | 205–310        | 450–620       | 500–1000       |
| Elongation (%)            | 40–60          | 40–55          | 25–35         | 15–25          |
| Hardness (Brinell)        | 150–200        | 150–200        | 250–300       | 200–400        |
| Modulus of Elasticity (GPa)| 193            | 193            | 200           | 200            |

### Corrosion Resistance and Types of Corrosion

1. **General Corrosion**: Uniform attack in aggressive acids.
2. **Pitting Corrosion**: Localized attack, especially in chloride environments.
3. **Crevice Corrosion**: Occurs in tight gaps.
4. **Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC)**: Combination of tensile stress and chlorides.
5. **Intergranular Corrosion**: Occurs in sensitized zones near welds.

### Standards and Specifications

- **ASTM**: A240 (plate), A276 (bar), A312 (pipe), A479 (forgings).
- **EN**: EN 10088 (flat products), EN 10217 (welded tubes).
- **ISO**: ISO 3506 (fasteners), ISO 15510 (chemical composition).
- **JIS**: JIS G4304 (plate), G4305 (sheet).

### Welding Stainless Steel

- **Recommended Methods**: TIG, MIG, plasma, resistance welding.
- **Filler Metals**: Match or overmatch base metal composition.
- **Post-Weld Treatment**: Pickling and passivation to restore corrosion resistance.
- **Avoid**: Carbon steel contamination, excessive heat input.

### Forming and Fabrication

- **Bending**: Minimum bend radius 2–3 × thickness.
- **Machining**: Lower speeds than carbon steel, use sharp tools.
- **Deep Drawing**: Austenitic grades have excellent drawability.

### Testing Methods

- **Tensile Testing**: ASTM E8.
- **Hardness Testing**: Rockwell, Brinell, Vickers.
- **Corrosion Testing**: ASTM G48 (pitting), G28 (intergranular).
- **Non-Destructive Testing**: Ultrasonic, dye penetrant, radiography.

### Best Engineering Practices

- Select grade based on environment and temperature.
- Specify proper surface finish.
- Use low-carbon or stabilized grades for welding.
- Apply passivation after fabrication.
- Design for thermal expansion.

This technical guide equips professionals with the knowledge to specify, fabricate, and maintain stainless steel components correctly and reliably.
