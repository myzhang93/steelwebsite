# Stainless Steel Grades – Complete Guide to Common Alloys and Their Properties

Stainless steel is one of the most versatile and widely used materials in modern industry, thanks to its exceptional combination of corrosion resistance, strength, formability, and aesthetics. The term “stainless steel” encompasses hundreds of different alloys, each formulated with specific elements to meet particular performance requirements. This comprehensive guide covers the major stainless steel grades, their chemical compositions, mechanical properties, typical applications, advantages, limitations, and selection criteria.

### What Makes Stainless Steel “Stainless”?

The key to stainless steel’s corrosion resistance is the formation of a thin, self-healing chromium oxide layer on the surface when exposed to oxygen. To qualify as stainless steel, the alloy must contain at least 10.5% chromium, though most commercial grades have 12–30%. Other alloying elements such as nickel, molybdenum, manganese, nitrogen, and carbon further modify properties.

### Major Stainless Steel Families

1. **Austenitic Stainless Steels (200 and 300 Series)**  
   Non-magnetic, excellent corrosion resistance and formability, most widely used.

2. **Ferritic Stainless Steels (400 Series)**  
   Magnetic, good corrosion resistance in mild environments, lower cost.

3. **Martensitic Stainless Steels (400 Series)**  
   Magnetic, hardenable by heat treatment, high strength and wear resistance.

4. **Duplex Stainless Steels**  
   Mixed austenitic-ferritic microstructure, high strength and excellent corrosion resistance.

5. **Precipitation-Hardening Stainless Steels (600 Series)**  
   High strength achieved through precipitation hardening, good corrosion resistance.

### Detailed Guide to Common Grades

#### 200 Series (Low-Nickel Austenitic)
- **201**: 16–18% Cr, 3.5–5.5% Ni, 5.5–7.5% Mn. Cost-effective alternative to 304.
- **202**: Slightly higher Ni and Mn than 201, better corrosion resistance.

#### 300 Series (Standard Austenitic)
- **304 / 304L**: 18% Cr, 8% Ni. Most common grade worldwide. Excellent general corrosion resistance.
- **316 / 316L**: 16–18% Cr, 10–14% Ni, 2–3% Mo. Superior pitting and crevice corrosion resistance.
- **321**: 17–19% Cr, 9–12% Ni, Ti stabilized. Excellent high-temperature oxidation resistance.
- **310 / 310S**: 24–26% Cr, 19–22% Ni. Outstanding high-temperature strength and oxidation resistance.

#### 400 Series (Ferritic and Martensitic)
- **409 / 439**: Low-cost ferritic grades for automotive exhaust systems.
- **430**: 16–18% Cr. Good corrosion resistance, used in decorative applications.
- **410 / 420**: Martensitic, hardenable. Used for cutlery, surgical instruments, and wear-resistant parts.

#### Duplex Grades
- **2205 (S31803/S32205)**: 22% Cr, 5% Ni, 3% Mo. Twice the yield strength of 304, excellent chloride resistance.
- **2507 (S32750)**: 25% Cr, 7% Ni, 4% Mo. Super duplex for extreme corrosion environments.

#### Precipitation-Hardening Grades
- **630 (17-4PH)**: 17% Cr, 4% Ni, 3–4% Cu. High strength and good corrosion resistance.
- **631 (17-7PH)**: Excellent fatigue resistance.

### Selection Criteria for Stainless Steel Grades

1. **Corrosion Environment**: Atmosphere, chlorides, acids, temperature.
2. **Mechanical Requirements**: Strength, hardness, toughness.
3. **Temperature Range**: Low-temperature ductility or high-temperature oxidation resistance.
4. **Fabrication Needs**: Weldability, formability, machinability.
5. **Cost Constraints**: Nickel content significantly affects price.
6. **Regulatory Requirements**: Food contact, medical, nuclear.
