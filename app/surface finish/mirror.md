# Mirror Finish Stainless Steel – No.8 / 8K Finish for Maximum Reflection

Mirror finish, also known as No.8 or 8K finish, is the highest level of polish achievable on stainless steel. It provides a true mirror-like surface with almost no visible grain, making it ideal for decorative and high-end applications.

### What is Mirror Finish?
Mirror finish is created by progressively finer polishing and buffing until the surface reflects light like a glass mirror.

### Detailed Production Process
1. Start from 2B or BA base.
2. Coarse grinding (60–120 grit).
3. Medium polishing (180–400 grit).
4. Fine polishing (600–1200 grit).
5. Buffing with diamond paste or cloth wheels.
6. Final cleaning and protective film application.

### Key Characteristics
- Extremely reflective, mirror-like surface.
- Surface roughness (Ra): < 0.05 µm.
- Maximum light reflection.
- Thickness typically 0.3–3 mm.

### Advantages
1. Stunning visual impact – true mirror appearance.
2. Excellent hygiene – very smooth surface prevents bacterial adhesion.
3. High corrosion resistance – when properly maintained.
4. Ideal for decoration – perfect for reflective and luxury applications.

### Limitations
- Shows fingerprints, scratches, and dust very easily.
- Highest cost among common finishes.
- Difficult to repair if damaged.
- Not suitable for high-wear areas.

### Typical Applications
- Architectural ceilings and reflectors.
- Luxury elevator doors and cabins.
- High-end appliances.
- Jewelry and decorative trim.
- Display cases and showcases.
- Retail and hotel interiors.

### Maintenance and Cleaning
- Use microfiber cloth and stainless steel cleaner.
- Avoid abrasive materials.
- Protective films are recommended during installation.

Mirror finish offers unmatched visual appeal and is the go-to choice for projects where appearance is paramount.
