# HL Finish Stainless Steel – Hairline Finish for Elegant Design

HL (Hairline) finish is a premium brushed finish characterized by extremely fine, continuous linear grain lines. It offers a softer, more sophisticated appearance than standard No.4 finish and is increasingly popular in luxury and high-end applications.

### What is HL Finish?
HL finish is created by polishing with very fine abrasives (240–320 grit) and special hairline polishing wheels to produce long, delicate, continuous lines.

### Detailed Production Process
1. Start from 2B or No.4 base.
2. Initial polishing with medium grits.
3. Final polishing with 240–320 grit belts and hairline wheels.
4. Cleaning and passivation.

### Key Characteristics
- Extremely fine, continuous linear pattern.
- Lower reflectivity than No.4.
- Very smooth to the touch.
- Excellent scratch and fingerprint resistance.

### Advantages
1. Premium aesthetic – elegant and sophisticated look.
2. Superior scratch resistance – hides fingerprints and minor scratches exceptionally well.
3. Modern luxury appeal – widely used in high-end design.
4. Good cleanability – smooth surface is easy to maintain.

### Limitations
- More expensive than No.4.
- Directional pattern requires careful installation.
- Less common and may have longer lead times.

### Typical Applications
- Luxury elevator cabins.
- High-end architectural interiors.
- Premium kitchen and bathroom fittings.
