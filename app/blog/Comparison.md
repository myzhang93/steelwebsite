# Stainless Steel Comparison – Grades, Finishes, Forms, and Properties

When selecting stainless steel for a project, comparing different grades, finishes, forms, and properties is essential to ensure optimal performance, cost-effectiveness, and longevity. This comprehensive 3000-word guide compares the most common stainless steel options across key categories, helping engineers, designers, and buyers make informed decisions.

### 1. Comparison of Major Stainless Steel Grades

#### Austenitic Grades (300 Series – Most Common)
- **304 vs. 316**  
  304: 18% Cr, 8% Ni – excellent general corrosion resistance, lowest cost in austenitic family.  
  316: 16–18% Cr, 10–14% Ni, 2–3% Mo – superior resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion, especially in chloride environments.  
  Verdict: Choose 316 for marine, chemical, or coastal applications; 304 for indoor or mild environments.

- **304 vs. 321**  
  321: Titanium-stabilized version of 304 – prevents intergranular corrosion after welding.  
  Verdict: Use 321 for high-temperature welded applications (e.g., exhaust systems).

- **304 vs. 310S**  
  310S: 25% Cr, 20% Ni – exceptional high-temperature oxidation resistance up to 1150°C.  
  Verdict: 310S for furnaces, heat exchangers, and kilns.

#### Ferritic vs. Austenitic Grades
- **430 vs. 304**  
  430: Magnetic, lower Ni content, lower cost, moderate corrosion resistance.  
  Verdict: 430 for decorative trim and non-critical applications; 304 for food-contact and structural parts.

#### Duplex vs. Austenitic
- **2205 Duplex vs. 316**  
  2205: 22% Cr, 5% Ni, 3% Mo – twice the yield strength, excellent chloride resistance.  
  Verdict: Duplex for high-strength, corrosive environments (oil & gas, desalination).

#### Precipitation-Hardening vs. Austenitic
- **630 (17-4PH) vs. 304**  
  630: Heat-treatable to high strength (up to 1300 MPa).  
  Verdict: Use 630 for aerospace, medical, and high-load applications.
