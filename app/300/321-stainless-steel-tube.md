# 321 Stainless Steel Tube – Titanium-Stabilised High-Temperature Champion for 870 °C Welded Tubing

When your tubing system must survive continuous exposure between 425 °C and 850 °C, only **321 Stainless Steel Tube** eliminates the risk of sensitisation and intergranular corrosion. The deliberate addition of titanium (≥5×C) locks up carbon as harmless TiC, preventing chromium depletion along grain boundaries during welding or long-term thermal cycling. This unique mechanism delivers full corrosion resistance after welding, excellent creep strength to 870 °C, and complete compatibility with standard welding procedures—making **321 stainless steel tube** the undisputed standard for aircraft exhaust tubing, furnace coils, thermal oxidizers, and high-temperature sanitary lines worldwide.
