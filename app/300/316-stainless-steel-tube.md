# 316 Stainless Steel Tube – The Marine-Grade Gold Standard for Chloride-Rich & Hygienic Applications

When your piping system faces chlorides, seawater, or aggressive chemicals, **316 Stainless Steel Tube** is the only logical choice. The deliberate addition of 2–3 % molybdenum transforms standard 18/8 stainless into a pitting- and crevice-corrosion-resistant alloy, outperforming 304 in marine, pharmaceutical, and food-processing environments. Whether you need seamless hydraulic lines for an offshore platform, sanitary dairy tubing, or architectural handrails on a coastal promenade, **316 stainless steel tube** delivers the hygiene, pressure integrity, and lifetime value that global industries demand.
