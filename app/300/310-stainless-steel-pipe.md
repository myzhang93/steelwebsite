# 310 Stainless Steel Pipe – The Ultimate High-Temperature Piping Solution for 1150 °C Continuous Service

When your process demands continuous exposure above 800 °C, only **310 Stainless Steel Pipe** delivers the reliability you need. With 25 % chromium and 20 % nickel, this austenitic grade forms a tenacious oxide scale that resists spalling even under cyclic thermal shock. Whether you are building furnace radiant tubes, petrochemical crackers, or power-station superheaters, **310 Stainless Steel Pipe** offers creep-rupture strength to 1150 °C – far outperforming 304, 321, or 309. The high nickel content maintains austenitic stability, while chromium provides exceptional oxidation and sulfidation resistance, making it the first choice for the world’s most aggressive high-temperature environments.
