# 321 Stainless Steel Pipe – Titanium-Stabilised High-Temperature Champion for 870 °C Service

When your piping system must survive the 425–850 °C danger zone, **321 Stainless Steel Pipe** is the only logical choice. The deliberate addition of titanium (≥5×C) locks up carbon as harmless TiC, preventing chromium depletion and intergranular corrosion during welding or long-term thermal exposure. This austenitic grade offers creep rupture strength to 870 °C, full weldability without post-weld anneal, and excellent oxidation resistance—making **321 Stainless Steel Pipe** the first choice for aircraft exhaust manifolds, furnace risers, refinery cat-crackers, and thermal oxidizer stacks worldwide.
