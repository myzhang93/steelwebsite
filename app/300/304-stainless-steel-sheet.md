# 304 Stainless Steel Sheet – Industrial-Grade Precision, Unmatched Corrosion Resistance

## Overview: Why 304 Stainless Steel Sheet is the Industry Standard
When your project demands a material that combines **superior corrosion resistance**, **excellent formability**, and **lifetime value**, the **304 Stainless Steel Sheet** is the undisputed choice. This austenitic grade pairs 18 % chromium and 8 % nickel to create a tough, non-magnetic surface that withstands aggressive chemicals, high humidity, and daily wear—making it the **go-to solution for food equipment, architectural panels, automotive trim, chemical containers, and countless OEM parts**.

### Key Benefits at a Glance
- **Superior corrosion & oxidation resistance** in most atmospheric and mild chemical environments  
- **Exceptional weldability and formability**—deep draw, brake-form, or TIG/MIG weld without post-anneal  
- **Hygienic, non-porous surface** meets FDA, NSF, and EU food-contact standards  
- **Available in 0.024" to 0.250" (24 Ga.–¼")** and widths up to 60" × 240"  
- **Zero maintenance**—no painting, plating, or protective coatings required  
- **100 % recyclable**—supports LEED credits and sustainability targets

## Features That Give You an Edge
1. **Corrosion Resistance** – 18 % Cr / 8 % Ni chemistry forms a self-healing chromium-oxide film that resists rust, pitting, and crevice attack in fresh water, most acids, and alkaline solutions.
2. **High-Temperature Strength** – Maintains mechanical integrity up to 870 °C (1 598 °F) in continuous service; intermittent exposure to 925 °C (1 697 °F) is possible.
3. **Superior Formability** – Low yield strength and high elongation (55 % min.) allow tight-radius bending, deep drawing, and spinning without cracking.
4. **Non-Magnetic in Annealed Condition** – Ideal for electronic housings, medical devices, and instrumentation where magnetic interference must be minimized.
5. **Excellent Finish Retention** – Whether you specify 2B, #4 brushed, #8 mirror, or BA, the surface keeps its luster after years of cleaning and sterilization cycles.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **Is 304 magnetic?**  
   It is essentially non-magnetic when annealed; slight magnetism may develop after cold work.
2. **Can I weld 304 without post-weld heat treatment?**  
   Yes, low-carbon 304L grade or standard 304 with proper filler (ER308L) needs no post-anneal in most applications.
3. **What is the difference between sheet and plate?**  
   Industry convention: ≤ 3/16" (0.1875") is sheet; &gt; 0.1875" is plate. We stock both and cut either to your net shape.
4. **Which finish hides fingerprints best?**  
   A #4 brushed finish diffuses light and shows fewer marks than 2B or #8 mirror.
5. **Do you offer export packaging?**  
   Yes, fumigation-free wooden cases, steel frames, and moisture-barrier VCI film for sea freight.
6. **How quickly can you ship a 304 perforated stainless steel sheet?**  
   Standard hole patterns ship in 2–3 days; custom perforation in 5–7 days.
