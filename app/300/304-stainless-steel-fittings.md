# 304 Stainless Steel Fittings – The World’s Most Versatile Food-Grade Piping Solution

For more than 70 years, **304 Stainless Steel Fittings** have set the global benchmark for corrosion-resistant, food-safe, and cost-effective piping assemblies. The balanced 18 % chromium / 8 % nickel chemistry delivers excellent resistance to atmospheric and mild chemical attack, while the austenitic structure provides outstanding formability and weldability without post-weld annealing. From brewery CIP lines and dairy pasteurizers to petrochemical cooling-water loops and architectural handrails, **304 Stainless Steel Fittings** offer the lowest life-cycle cost of any stainless grade in general-service applications—making them the first choice for engineers, contractors, and stockists worldwide.
