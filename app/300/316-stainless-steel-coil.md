# 316 Stainless Steel Coil – Marine-Grade Excellence for the Toughest Corrosive Environments

When chloride ions attack, **316 Stainless Steel Coil** fights back. The deliberate addition of 2–3 % molybdenum transforms standard 18/8 stainless into a pitting- and crevice-corrosion-resistant powerhouse, making **316 Stainless Steel Coil** the default choice for shipyards, pharmaceutical reactors, food-dairy lines, and coastal architecture. Whether you are deep-drawing heat-exchanger shells, laser-welding hypo-tubes, or fabricating luxury yacht handrails, this coil delivers the cleanliness, surface consistency, and long-term durability that premium projects demand—without the premium price of super-austenitic grades.
