# 304 Stainless Steel Plate – The World’s Most Versatile & Cost-Effective Stainless Grade

For more than 70 years, **304 Stainless Steel Plate** has set the global benchmark for corrosion resistance, formability, weldability, and value. Its balanced 18 % chromium / 8 % nickel chemistry delivers excellent resistance to atmospheric and mild chemical attack, while the austenitic structure provides outstanding deep-drawing and forming capability without post-weld annealing. From food-processing tanks and architectural façades to automotive trims and **304 stainless steel license plate frame** blanks, **304 stainless steel plate** offers the lowest life-cycle cost of any stainless grade—making it the first choice for kitchenware manufacturers, architects, and metal fabricators worldwide.
