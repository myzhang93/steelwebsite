# 303 Stainless Steel Pipe – The World’s Most Machinable Stainless Steel Piping Solution

When your production line needs to run faster, **303 Stainless Steel Pipe** delivers. With 0.15–0.35 % sulfur deliberately added, this free-machining grade offers **2–3× higher machining speeds** than standard 304 or 316 while still providing good corrosion resistance for mild-service applications. The coil-to-pipe process maintains the same chip-breaking advantage, allowing automatic screw machines and CNC lathes to produce precision fittings, shafts, and instrumentation tubing at maximum throughput. Whether you need bright-polished hydraulic lines or custom-machined valve bodies, **303 Stainless Steel Pipe** gives you the productivity of brass with the prestige and corrosion resistance of stainless steel.
