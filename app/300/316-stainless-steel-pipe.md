# 316 Stainless Steel Pipe – Marine-Grade Champion for the World’s Most Aggressive Environments

For more than six decades, **316 Stainless Steel Pipe** has reigned as the undisputed champion of marine and chemical piping. The strategic addition of **2.0–3.0 % molybdenum** transforms standard 18/8 stainless into a pitting- and crevice-corrosion-resistant powerhouse, outperforming 304 in chloride-rich seawater, aggressive chemical brines, and coastal atmospheres. Whether you are building a desalination plant, fabricating yacht exhaust systems, or installing pharmaceutical WFI lines, **316 Stainless Steel Pipe** delivers the cleanliness, pressure integrity, and lifetime value that premium projects demand.
