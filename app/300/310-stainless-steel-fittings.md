# 310 Stainless Steel Fittings – The Ultimate High-Temperature Solution for 1150 °C Continuous Service

When your piping system must survive continuous exposure above 800 °C, only **310 Stainless Steel Fittings** deliver the reliability you need. With 25 % chromium and 20 % nickel, this austenitic grade forms a tenacious oxide scale that resists spalling even under cyclic thermal shock. Whether you are building furnace radiant tubes, petrochemical crackers, or power-station superheaters, **310 Stainless Steel Fittings** offer creep-rupture strength to 1150 °C – far outperforming 304, 321, or 309. The high nickel content maintains austenitic stability, while chromium provides exceptional oxidation and sulfidation resistance, making **310 stainless steel pipe fittings** the first choice for the world’s most aggressive high-temperature environments.
