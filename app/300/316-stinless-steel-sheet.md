# 316 Stainless Steel Sheet – Marine-Grade Corrosion Resistance for Demanding Projects

When your application battles chlorides, salt spray, or aggressive chemicals, **316 Stainless Steel Sheet** is the premium upgrade you can’t afford to skip. Compared with the widely used 304 grade, 316 contains 2–3 % molybdenum, a strategic alloying addition that shuts down pitting and crevice corrosion in marine atmospheres and acidic brines. The result is a longer service life, lower maintenance budgets, and compliance with stringent FDA, USP, and offshore specifications—all in one versatile, fully austenitic material. From yacht decks and coastal cladding to pharmaceutical autoclaves and food-processing lines, specifying **316 Stainless Steel Sheet** today prevents costly field failures tomorrow.

## FAQ – 316 Stainless Steel Sheet
1. **What is the main advantage of 316 over 304?**  
   The 2–3 % molybdenum addition gives 316 far greater resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion in chloride environments.

2. **How is 316L different from 316?**  
   316L has a 0.03 % max carbon versus 0.08 %, reducing carbide precipitation during welding; strength is marginally lower.

3. **Where can I download a 316 stainless steel data sheet?**  
   Click the “Download PDF” button on this page for ASTM A240 values, MTR template, and processing guidelines.

4. **What gauges are normally stocked?**  
   Table 3 lists 24 Ga to ¼"; other thicknesses 0.5 mm–25 mm available by mill order.

5. **Is 316 stainless steel sheet suitable for baking applications?**  
   Yes, 316L baking sheets offer superior corrosion resistance to salty or acidic foods and meet FDA & USP standards.

6. **Who is the best supplier of 316 stainless steel sheet?**  
   Look for ISO-certified stockists with in-house cutting, live pricing, and mill traceability—criteria we satisfy worldwide.
