## FAQ – 303 Stainless Steel Coil
1. **What is the machinability rating of 303?**  
   90 % (excellent) vs 45 % for 304 – chip break-up is superior, tool life 2–3× longer.

2. **Can 303 coil be welded?**  
   Welding is not recommended due to hot-cracking risk; use 304 or 347 for welded joints and bolt on 303 parts.

3. **How does corrosion resistance compare with 304?**  
   Slightly lower because of sulfur; adequate for indoor, food, and mild atmospheric service.

4. **What thickness tolerance do you guarantee?**  
   ASTM A480/A895 standard; half-tolerance possible on request (±0.02 mm).

5. **How do I check current coil stock availability?**  
   Login to our portal – live tonnage, coil ID, location, and certificate number updated every 30 minutes.

6. **What is the minimum order quantity?**  
   One slit coil (≥500 kg) for stock items; master coils from 3 tons for mill direct.

7. **How often does the price change?**  
   Linked to LME nickel and sulfur additive index – updated daily at 08:00 CST; fixed for 48 h after quotation.

8. **Which surface finishes are in stock?**  
   2B, BA, No.4, HL, and micro-peeled; custom polishing up to Ra 0.1 µm available.
