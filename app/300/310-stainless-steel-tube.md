# 310 Stainless Steel Tube – The Ultimate High-Temperature Tubing Solution for 1150 °C Continuous Service

When your process demands continuous exposure above 800 °C, only **310 Stainless Steel Tube** delivers the reliability you need. With 25 % chromium and 20 % nickel, this austenitic grade forms a tenacious oxide scale that resists spalling even under cyclic thermal shock up to 1100 °C. Its high nickel content maintains austenitic stability, while chromium provides exceptional oxidation, sulfidation, and carburization resistance—making **310 stainless steel tube** dramatically superior to 304, 316, or 321 in furnace radiant tubes, petrochemical crackers, and power-station superheaters worldwide.
