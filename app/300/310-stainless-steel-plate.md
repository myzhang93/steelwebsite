# 310 Stainless Steel Plate – The Undisputed King of High-Temperature Stainless Plates for 1150 °C Service

When your furnace, kiln, or petrochemical reactor demands continuous exposure above 800 °C, only **310 Stainless Steel Plate** delivers the reliability you need. With 25 % chromium and 20 % nickel, this austenitic grade forms a tenacious oxide scale that resists spalling even under cyclic thermal shock up to 1100 °C. Its high nickel content maintains austenitic stability, while chromium provides exceptional oxidation, sulfidation, and carburization resistance—making **310 stainless steel plate** dramatically superior to 304, 316, or 321 in furnace bases, radiant tube sheets, and power-station boiler shields worldwide.
