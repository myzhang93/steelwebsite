# 303 Stainless Steel Sheet – The Free-Machining Champion for High-Speed Production

When your CNC spindle time counts, **303 Stainless Steel Sheet** pays for itself every minute. With a deliberate sulfur addition (0.15 % min.), 303 delivers up to **three times faster machining** than standard 304 while still providing the corrosion resistance needed for indoor, mild-service, or decorative applications. From high-volume automatic screw-machine fittings to designer kitchen backsplashes, **303 Stainless Steel Sheet** gives you excellent chip break-up, superior surface finish, and dramatically reduced tool wear—without the costly slowdowns common to 304 or 316 grades.
