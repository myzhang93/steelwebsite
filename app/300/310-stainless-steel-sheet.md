# 310 Stainless Steel Sheet – The Ultimate High-Temperature Material for Extreme Heat Environments

When your application demands continuous service above 800 °C, **310 Stainless Steel Sheet** is the material that stands the test of time. With a unique combination of 25 % chromium and 20 % nickel, this austenitic grade offers outstanding oxidation resistance up to 1100 °C and continuous operation to 1150 °C—far exceeding the limits of 304, 316, or 321 stainless steels. From furnace linings and radiant tubes to thermocouple shields and petrochemical crackers, **310 Stainless Steel Sheet** maintains creep strength, resists thermal fatigue, and minimizes costly downtime in the most extreme thermal environments.

## FAQ – 310 Stainless Steel Sheet
1. **What is the continuous temperature limit?**  
   1150 °C in air; intermittent up to 1100 °C [^4^].

2. **How does 310 differ from 310S?**  
   310S is low-carbon (0.08 % max) for better weldability and thermal cycling.

3. **Which finish is best for furnace linings?**  
   No.1 HRAP finish is standard; bright annealed 2B can be used when lower emissivity is desired.

4. **What affects the 310 stainless steel sheet price?**  
   LME nickel, chromium, energy costs, thickness tolerance, and cutting pattern—our live calculator shows every component.

5. **Can I download a 310 stainless steel material property data sheet?**  
   Yes, PDF is auto-generated after RFQ and includes creep curves from 600 °C to 1000 °C.

6. **Which mills are the top 310 stainless steel sheet factories in China?**  
   TISCO, Tsingshan, and Baosteel are leading producers; we hold mill-direct allocation agreements with all three.

7. **Is 310 magnetic?**  
   Austenitic grades are generally non-magnetic after annealing; slight magnetism may appear after heavy cold work.

8. **How fast can you deliver from your China base?**  
   7 days production + 3–5 days ocean freight to Asian ports; 10 days to EU/US warehouses.
