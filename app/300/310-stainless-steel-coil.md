# 310 Stainless Steel Coil – The Ultimate High-Temperature Austenitic Alloy for 1150 °C Service

When your equipment faces continuous temperatures above 800 °C, **310 Stainless Steel Coil** is the material you can trust. With 25 % chromium and 20 % nickel, this austenitic grade delivers exceptional oxidation resistance up to 1100 °C in cyclic conditions and continuous service to 1150 °C—far exceeding the limits of 304, 321, or 让 even 309. Its high chromium content forms a tenacious oxide scale that resists spalling, while the nickel level maintains austenitic stability and ductility after prolonged thermal exposure. From radiant tubes and kiln linings to boiler baffles and thermocouple protection tubes, **310 Stainless Steel Coil** provides the creep strength, sulfidation resistance, and structural reliability that high-temperature industries demand.

## FAQ – 310 Stainless Steel Coil
1. **What is the maximum continuous service temperature?**  
   1150 °C in air; intermittent up to 1100 °C with minimal scale growth.

2. **What is the difference between 310 and 310S?**  
   310S is low-carbon (0.08 % max) for better weldability and thermal cycling; strength slightly lower.

3. **How does the coil price compare with 309S?**  
   310 is ~15 % higher due to extra nickel; longer life often offsets premium.

4. **Which welding consumables should I use?**  
   AWS E310-15 or ER310 bare wire; pre-heat not required, post-weld anneal optional.

5. **Do you stock hot-rolled and cold-rolled 310 stainless steel coil?**  
   Yes, 0.4–50 mm thickness, 1000–2000 mm width, 45 000 t ready inventory.

6. **How fast can you deliver from China?**  
   7 days production + 3–5 days ocean freight to Asian ports; 10 days to EU/US warehouses.

7. **What is the minimum order quantity?**  
   One slit coil (≥500 kg) for stock items; master coils from 3 tons for mill direct.

8. **Can I download a mill test certificate?**  
   Yes, EN 10204 3.1/3.2 MTC is auto-generated after RFQ and includes elevated-temperature creep curves.
