# 321 Stainless Steel Fittings – Titanium-Stabilised High-Temperature Champions for 870 °C Welded Systems

When your piping assembly must survive continuous exposure between 425 °C and 850 °C, only **321 Stainless Steel Fittings** eliminate the risk of sensitisation and intergranular corrosion. The deliberate addition of titanium (≥5×C) locks up carbon as harmless TiC, preventing chromium depletion along grain boundaries during welding or long-term thermal cycling. This unique mechanism delivers full corrosion resistance after welding, excellent creep strength to 870 °C, and complete compatibility with standard welding procedures—making **321 Stainless Steel Fittings** the undisputed standard for aircraft exhaust manifolds, furnace ducting, thermal oxidizers, and petrochemical flare lines worldwide.

## FAQ – 321 Stainless Steel Fittings
1. **Why 321 instead of 304 after welding?**  
   321 resists sensitisation and intergranular corrosion in the 425–850 °C range; 304 does not.

2. **What is the maximum service temperature?**  
   870 °C continuous; intermittent to 900 °C with acceptable scaling rate.

3. **Price vs 304/316 fittings?**  
   321 is ~10 % higher than 304, ~20 % lower than 316; longer life often offsets premium.

4. **Stock availability for special **321 stainless steel pipe fitting**?**  
   25 000 t ready stock; specials machined within 7 days.

5. **Lead time for large orders?**  
   5 days for standard **321 stainless steel pipe fittings**; 10 days for custom CNC specials.

6. **Which welding procedures are recommended?**  
   TIG with ER321 filler; pre-heat not required; post-weld stabilising anneal optional.
