# 321 Stainless Steel Coil – Titanium-Stabilised High-Temperature Excellence

When your process hits 425–850 °C, everyday stainless steels sensitize and fail. **321 Stainless Steel Coil** solves this with titanium (≥5×C) that ties up carbon as harmless TiC, preventing chromium depletion and intergranular corrosion. The result is a coil that retains full corrosion resistance after welding, offers creep strength to 870 °C, and feeds high-speed stamping lines for aircraft exhausts, furnace liners, and water-heater sheaths. If you need a material that survives thermal cycles without post-weld annealing, **321 Stainless Steel Coil** is the undisputed champion.
