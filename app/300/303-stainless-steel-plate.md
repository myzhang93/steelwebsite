# 303 Stainless Steel Plate – The World’s Most Machinable Stainless Grade for High-Volume CNC Production

When your CNC or automatic screw machine needs to run faster, **303 Stainless Steel Plate** delivers the competitive edge. With 0.15–0.35 % sulfur deliberately added, this free-machining grade offers 2–3× higher machining speeds and superior chip-breaking compared to standard 304 or 316, while still providing good corrosion resistance for mild-service applications. From precision-machined valve bodies and pump parts to food-processing equipment bases and electronic housings, **303 stainless steel plate** maximises spindle uptime, extends tool life, and reduces unit cost—making it the first choice for high-volume producers of turned, milled, or ground components worldwide.
