# 303 Stainless Steel Fittings – The World’s No.1 Free-Machining Grade for High-Volume CNC Production

When your automatic screw machine or CNC lathe needs to run faster, **303 Stainless Steel Fittings** deliver the competitive edge. With 0.15–0.35 % sulfur deliberately added, this austenitic grade offers 2–3× higher machining speeds and superior chip-breaking compared to standard 304 or 316, while still providing good corrosion resistance for mild-service applications. From bright-bar hex nipples and hose barbs to precision-turned instrumentation elbows, **303 Stainless Steel Fittings** maximise spindle uptime, extend tool life, and reduce unit cost—making them the first choice for high-volume producers of pneumatic, hydraulic, and food-processing components worldwide.
