# 321 Stainless Steel Sheet – Titanium-Stabilised Heat-Resistant Excellence

When engineers face continuous service between 400 °C and 800 °C, **321 Stainless Steel Sheet** is the material they trust. By adding titanium (min. 5 × C content), this austenitic grade resists sensitisation and inter-granular corrosion that can plague standard 304 or 316 after welding or long-term thermal exposure. The titanium stabilisation ties up carbon as harmless TiC particles, leaving chromium free to maintain the passive film—so welds stay ductile and parent metal retains full corrosion resistance without post-weld annealing. Whether you fabricate jet-engine exhaust cones, chemical-refinery expansion joints, or high-temperature autoclave shells, **321 Stainless Steel Sheet** delivers outstanding strength, oxidation resistance, and fabricability in one cost-effective solution.

## Key Features & Advantages
- Titanium stabilised (Ti ≥ 5×C) – immunity to sensitisation and knife-line attack
- Service range –55 °C to 870 °C (intermittent) with good scaling resistance
- Excellent weldability – no post-weld stabilising heat treatment required
- Higher elevated-temperature creep strength than 304/316
- Smooth surface finishes – 2B, BA, HL, No. 4 – ideal for aerospace skins
- Non-magnetic in annealed condition; low magnetic permeability after cold work
- Full compliance – ASTM A240, ASME SA-240, EN 1.4541, PED 2014/68/EU

## FAQ – 321 Stainless Steel Sheet
1. **What is the continuous operating temperature limit?**  
   ~850 °C in air; scaling becomes significant above 900 °C.

2. **How does titanium stabilisation work?**  
   Titanium combines with carbon to form TiC, preventing chromium depletion at grain boundaries during welding or service 450–800 °C.

3. **Can I use 321 instead of 304 for cost saving?**  
   321 costs ≈20 % more than 304 but saves post-weld annealing; economically justified for high-temp or cyclic service.

4. **What thicknesses are available from China stock?**  
   0.4 mm to 25 mm in standard sheets; coils from 0.1 mm; all sizes ready for immediate sale.

5. **How often is the 321 stainless steel sheet pricelist updated?**  
   Daily at 08:00 CST based on LME Ni and Fe-Ti indices; lock your price for 48 h with a 30 % deposit.
