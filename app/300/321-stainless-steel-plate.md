# 321 Stainless Steel Plate – Titanium-Stabilised High-Temperature Champion for 870 °C Welded Structures

When your equipment must survive continuous exposure between 425 °C and 850 °C, only **321 Stainless Steel Plate** eliminates the risk of sensitisation and intergranular corrosion. The deliberate addition of titanium (≥5×C) locks up carbon as harmless TiC, preventing chromium depletion along grain boundaries during welding or long-term thermal cycling. This unique mechanism delivers full corrosion resistance after welding, excellent creep strength to 870 °C, and complete compatibility with standard welding procedures—making **321 stainless steel plate** the undisputed standard for aircraft exhaust stacks, furnace baffles, thermal oxidizer shells, refinery flare stacks, and high-temperature expansion bellows worldwide.
